            This is a working draft version of our Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy.
            As we evolve from manual to automated audits, timelines and conditions may be updated for transparency.

          <h3>1. Cancellation Before Work Begins</h3>
          <p>
            If you cancel within 24 hours of payment and before any work has started, a full refund will be issued,
            minus any Razorpay transaction fees.

          <h3>2. After Work Has Commenced</h3>
          <p>
            Once analysis, communication, or any form of audit work has begun, full refunds are not available.
            If we fail to deliver within the committed timeline without prior notice, a partial refund
            (up to 50% of the service fee) may be considered at our discretion.

            <li>Inputs are incomplete or missing despite reminders.</li>
            <li>Delays are caused by the client’s unavailability or late responses.</li>
            <li>The report has already been delivered.</li>
            <li>Disagreement is based purely on subjective opinion or stylistic preference.</li>
